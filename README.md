# Digit-Recognizer
This is the repo for my second task as an Artificial Intelligence Intern at SYNC INTERN'S. Digit Recognizer is a CNN model to predict handwritten digits (0 to 9).
The task passed through different steps such as Data Preprocessing, Building the CNN model, Data Augmentation, Learning Rate Scheduling, Regularization (Dropout), and Early Stopping.
After that, Evaluating the model, saving it, and the final step (prediction).
